* Bash keeps the history in the buffer and doesn't write it to the history log until you log out.

* To repeat the last command: `!!`

* If you want to see what's been added in real time to the end of a file, use `-f` flag with `tail` command: `tail -f output.txt`

* While `ctrl + c` sends the `SIGINT` signal (short for signal intrrupt), `ctrl + d` sends the `SiGQUIT` signal which is a stronger signal.

* These are the ways to quit VIM (first make sure you're in the command mode by hitting escape): 
  
  * `:q` if you haven't made any changes to the file.
  * `:wq` saves the file and quits.
  * `:q!` if you don't want to save changes.
  * `:qa` go to hell VIM.
  
* `less` command is good for reading long files. You can use `\searchterm` to search for sth while in `less`.

* To create multiple folders nested into each other: `mkdir -p my/nested/folder`

* To `tar` the files and folders: `tar -zcf archive.tar.gz file1 folder1` and to `untar` them `tar -xzf archive.tar.gz destination`.

* `&` after a command means run it in the background. For example: `yes > /dev/null &`.

* To see the list of users: `cat /etc/passwd`

* `sudo su` will create a session where you are the superuser. Write `exit` to exit this session.
